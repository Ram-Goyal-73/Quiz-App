# Quiz App

The Quiz App is a web-based gaming website inspired by the popular TV show "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire." It offers an exciting quiz experience where players can answer questions and earn virtual money based on their correct answers.

## Features

- User Registration: Players can input their username before starting the quiz to personalize their gaming experience.
- Dynamic Music: The app plays different music tracks based on the user's answer, adding an immersive element to the gameplay.
- Question Timer: Each question is accompanied by a timer, creating a sense of urgency and adding an additional challenge.
- Multiple-choice Questions: Players are presented with a variety of multiple-choice questions covering different topics and difficulty levels.

- Responsive Design: While the app is fully responsive, please note that it is not specifically optimized for smaller displays like phones. It may appear slightly cramped in certain areas, such as the show page, particularly with questions that have lengthy descriptions.
